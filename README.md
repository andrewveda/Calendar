The Department of English, SRM Valliammai Engineering College has adopted a gamified learning framework comprising Leaderboards, Daily Quests, and Video Quests. These elements are designed to enhance student motivation, cognitive engagement, and self-regulated learning. The approach draws from principles of constructivist pedagogy, intrinsic motivation theory, and behaviourist reinforcement, ensuring that learning remains continuous, inclusive, and measurable.

1. Gamified Leaderboard

Psychological Basis: Utilises principles of social comparison theory and achievement motivation to drive student participation.

Pedagogical Impact: Encourages formative assessment through visible progress markers and fosters peer accountability.

Learning Outcomes:

Enhances goal orientation by making progress explicit.

Builds self-efficacy as students see their incremental improvement.

Promotes healthy competition, reinforcing persistence and resilience.

2. Daily Quests

Psychological Basis: Applies spaced repetition and habit formation theory to promote long-term retention.

Pedagogical Impact: Implements scaffolding by breaking down complex skills into small, structured tasks.

Learning Outcomes:

Strengthens metacognition, as students reflect on daily progress.

Supports equitable learning, ensuring inclusivity for learners of varying proficiency.

Reinforces consistency and discipline, essential traits in lifelong learning.

3. Video Quests

Psychological Basis: Based on dual coding theory (integration of visual and verbal input) and multimodal learning principles.

Pedagogical Impact: Enhances blended learning environments, integrating ICT with traditional pedagogy.

Learning Outcomes:

Improves listening comprehension and critical thinking.

Encourages reflective practice by linking audiovisual material to higher-order questioning.

Develops autonomous learning, as students engage with multimedia resources beyond classroom boundaries.

Overall Impact

Motivation: Increased through a blend of extrinsic rewards (leaderboards) and intrinsic satisfaction (quest completion).

Cognition: Reinforced by incremental progression, retrieval practice, and multimodal input.

Affective Domain: Nurtures confidence, perseverance, and collaborative spirit.

Pedagogy: Moves from teacher-centred delivery to learner-centred, activity-based learning, aligning with contemporary educational psychology.

Conclusion

The integration of Leaderboards, Daily Quests, and Video Quests exemplifies how gamification can operationalise psychological theories of motivation and cognition within a pedagogically sound framework. The result is a learning environment that is engaging, inclusive, and conducive to holistic student development.
